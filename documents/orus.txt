Orus is a grammar for querying time series data.

Grammar is defined by:
1. DELIMITERS
2. TICKERS
3. FUNCTIONS
4. TIMEFRAME

Delimiters define the types of data point.
Tickers define which type the data point belongs to.
And functions define the actual metric for the data point and are split by commas (",")
Timeframe consists of time value and time unit.

We have the following delimiters:
1. C -> Chain
2. A -> Asset
3. APP -> Application
4. LP -> Liquidity pool
5. SEC -> Sector
6. UC -> Use case
7. DAO -> Decentralised organisation
8. ECO -> Ecosystem

We have the following tickers.
For chain (C):
1. ETH -> Ethereum
2. POLYGON -> Polygon

For assets (A):
1. ETH -> Ether
2. MATIC -> Matic
3. USDC -> USD Coin
4. MKR -> Maker

For applications (APP):
1. AAVEV2 -> Aave version 2 (v2)
2. AAVEV3 -> Aave version 3 (v3)
3. COMPV2 -> Compound version 2 (v2)
4. COMPV3 -> Compound version 3 (v3)
5. UNIV2 -> Uniswap version 2 (v2)
6. UNIV3 -> Uniswap version 3 (v3)
7. SUSHI -> Sushiswap
8. BALANCERV1 -> Balancer version 1 (v1)
9. BALANCERV2 -> Balancer version 2 (v2)

For decentralised organizations (DAO):
1. UNI -> Uniswap
2. SUSHI -> Sushi

For ecosystems (ECO):
1. ETH -> Ethereum
2. POLYGON -> Polygon

Liquidity pool (LP) tickers are a special type of tickers that are generated by mixing asset (A) tickers with "-". Any combination of assets can be used.
For example:
1. ETH-USDC
2. USDC-MKR-MATIC

Functions are the following:
1. P -> Price in USD
2. PBTC -> Price in bitcoin
3. PETH -> Price in ether
4. MC -> Market cap
5. TXC -> Transaction count
6. TXV -> Transaction volume in USD
7. TXVN -> Transaction volume in native asset
8. TFC -> Transfer count
9. TFV -> Transfer volume in USD
10. TFVN -> Transfer volume in native asset
11. CSUP -> Circulating supply
12. BRRR -> Inflation rate
13. MINT -> Number of minted tokens
14. BURN -> Number of burnt tokens
15. NISS -> Network issuance
16. HODL -> Number of token holders
17. DAU -> Daily active users
18. NEWSC -> Number of new smart contracts
19. NEW -> Number of new addresses
20. TGFEE -> Total gas fees
21. AGFEE -> Average gas fees
22. MGFEE -> Median gas fees
23. EARN -> Revenue
24. NVT -> NVT
25. SUSR -> Fees to issuance ratio
26. SC -> Swap count
27. DC -> Deposit count
28. WC -> Withdrawal count
29. REPC -> Repay count
30. BC -> Borrow count
31. DV -> Deposit volume in USD
32. DVN -> Deposit volume in native asset
33. WV -> Withdrawal volume in USD
34. WVN -> Withdrawal volume in native asset
35. BV -> Borrow volume in USD
36. BVN -> Borrow volume in native asset
37. REPV -> Repay volume in USD
38. REPVN -> Repay volume in native asset
39. SV -> Swap volume in USD
40. SVN -> Swap volume in native asset
41. SVS -> Swap volume sell in USD (how much was sold)
42. SVB -> Swap volume buy in USD (how much was bought)
43. SVS -> Swap volume sell in native asset (how much was sold)
44. SVB -> Swap volume buy in native asset (how much was bought)
45. L -> Liquidity in USD
46. LN -> Liquidity in native asset
47. SR -> Lending rate
48. BR -> Borrowing rate

The timeframe follows the format of number of time units + time unit.
It is always defined at the end.
3D -> 3 days
10M -> 10 months
2Y -> 2 years

Possible time units are:
1. D -> day
2. M -> month
3. Y -> year

The dsl has the following form:
[TICKER1, TICKER2]DELIMITER1 [TICKER3, TICKER4]DELIMITER2 FUNCTION1, FUNCTION2 TIME_VALUE TIME_UNIT

Examples of queries:
[USDC, MKR]A P 50D
[ETH]C [BALANCERV1, AAVEV2]APP TXC 2Y
[USDC-WETH, MKR-USDC-WBTC]LP [SUSHI]APP L, TXC 50D
[WETH, WBTC]A [ETH, POLYGON]C TXC, TXV, P, PBTC 1Y

Tickers of the same type should be enclosed with a single delimiter.
For example, ether and matic are tickers for asset delimiter, and should be formed like this:
[ETH, MATIC]A

Aave and compound are tickers for the asset delimiter, and should be formed like this:
[AAVE, COMP]APP

Functions should always go after the delimiters and separated by a comma (,), and timeframe should always go at the end.
Meaning this is not the correct query:
[ETH, MATIC]A TXC [ETH]C 30D

But this is:
[ETH, MATIC]A [ETH]C TXC 30D

The query for price of ether on ethereum chain for the past 10 days would be:
[ETH]C [ETH]A P 10D

Swap count for aave in the past 3 months would be:
[AAVE]APP SC 3M
